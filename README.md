- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kacyk27
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in nuclear physics, diagnostic systems in medicine, astronomy and playing games like MOBA (LOL), shooters (CS:GO), simulators (World of Tanks). 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web developing. I finished my education of Python and I'm ready to become Python Developer. As a matter of fact now I'm gonna studying about Web Dev,
but in future I'll back to learn Django, Flask, for web apps in Python and then study Numpy, Pandas and other tools for Data Science and Machine learning. I had some basics of Numpy and Pandas during
studies. What is more I really liked my project from cryptography and I want to create more ciphers, but currently I don't have enough time for this.
- I'm during last year of IT studies and I'm looking for intership or work as a junior developer.
