- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kacyk27
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in nuclear physics, diagnostic systems in medicine, astronomy and playing games like MOBA (LOL), shooters (CS:GO), simulators (World of Tanks). 
- ðŸŒ± I am a graduate of the University of RzeszÃ³w. The fields of study I have completed are:
Diagnostic systems in medicine - Engineer degree </br>
Title of thesis: Identification of volatile organic compounds of biological importance by infrared spectroscopy
****
Computer Science - Master's degree</br>
Title of thesis: Methods of calculating and visualizing cuts on values attributes representing gene expression</br>
In thesis I used results obtained with the application which use data analyse, visualisations and machine learning in python.

Currently Iâ€™m working as junior fullstack developer since August 2022, previously I participated in the internship since May 2022. This is my techstack in work:</br>
Frontend: JS + Vue 2.x/3.x</br>
Backend: Java + Spring </br>
Databases: SQL - PostgreSQL, SQLite dialects.</br>

Python is still my main technology. Data analyse, visualisations and elements of machine learning are my main direction for future, but for this moment I mostly focus to develop my skills from techstack used in job.
